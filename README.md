## Download & Installation
These will only work for windows.

- Pick the cursor set you want from the release page or below.
- Download the .zip file named after the character and unpack the .ani files it contains in some folder where you won't delete them.
- To activate them follow [this Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTfSGtudh84) which will work on win10 and win11.
- File names with `alt` at the end indicate that they can be used as an alternative option to the defualt cursor. It is recommended to stay consistent within one cursor style as it might look weird otherwise. The cursor type `Alternative selection` can be chosen from the other two unused `Normal Selection` files.
